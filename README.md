# E-commerce Back End Starter Code


## Description
As a manager at an internet retail company, I want to develop a back end for my e-commerce website that utilizes the latest technologies. This application provides a fully functional back-end API built with Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL, which enables our company to remain competitive in the e-commerce market. The API allows us to manage categories, products, and tags effectively through GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
